<analysis>**original_problem_statement**:
The user's initial goal was to build a full-stack classifieds application. The project has since expanded to include an SEO suite, AI tools, deep linking, and A/B testing features.

Recent requests:
1.  **Search Page UI Refinements (Completed)**: A series of iterative requests to modify the search results page ():
    *   Align the category menu style with the homepage.
    *   Make the category row responsive (1 row on large screens, 2 on small) and remove its background.
    *   Left-align the category items.
    *   Align the search input and location selector with the header's logo and Post Listing button, respectively.
    *   Remove the Browse by Category section.
    *   Perform a major layout refactor to fix alignment issues across all content rows (search, categories, and results) to ensure they are perfectly aligned with the main header.
2.  **Property Listing Card Enhancement (Completed)**: On the Properties category page, update the listing cards to display icons and values for the number of rooms, bathrooms, and size, positioned after the listing title.
3.  **New Request**: Navigate to the auto and vehicle category page for further modifications.

**User's preferred language**: English

**what currently exists?**
A full-stack classifieds application. In this session, the agent performed extensive UI refinements on the search results page and enhanced the property listing cards.

1.  **Search Page Overhaul**: The agent iteratively refactored the search page (). A new layout pattern was established using full-width wrapper containers and max-width inner containers to ensure the search bar, category icons, and search results all perfectly align with the main header content. The category row is now responsive and styled consistently.
2.  **Property Card Enhancement**: The agent updated the properties category page () to use the correct  component in the desktop view. This card now successfully displays icons and data for bedrooms, bathrooms, and size, which are fetched from the listing's attributes.

The agent has just navigated to the auto and vehicle category page at the user's request and is awaiting instructions.

**Last working item**:
The user has directed the agent to the auto and vehicle category page, and the agent has presented a screenshot of that page, pending the user's next instruction.

- **Last item agent was working**: Awaiting user feedback/request for the auto and vehicle category page.
- **Status**: BLOCKED (waiting for user instruction)
- **Agent Testing Done**: Y (via screenshot)
- **Which testing method agent to use?**: screenshot tool
- **User Testing Done**: N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
There are no pending bugs. All user-reported issues from this session have been resolved.

**In progress Task List**:
There are no tasks currently in progress.

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
-   **(P0) Auto & Vehicle Page Modifications**: Implement changes on the auto and vehicle category page based on the user's next instructions.
-   **(P1) SEO Optimization**: Conduct a full SEO audit and implement optimizations like dynamic meta tags, structured data (JSON-LD), and a sitemap.
-   **(P2) Admin Controls Page**: Create a page for admins to enable/disable features (view counts, save stats, etc.).
-   **(P2) User Verification for Past UI Fixes**: Confirm the repositioned heart icon on Similar Listings is correct.
-   **(P3) Refactor **: Remove unused, commented-out components.

**Completed work in this session**
-   **Search Page Layout and Alignment (DONE)**: Performed a major refactor of , creating a consistent, aligned layout for the search bar, category row, and results grid, matching the main header's boundaries.
-   **Search Page Category Row Styling (DONE)**: Removed the background, made the category row responsive to screen size (wrapping to two rows), and left-aligned the items.
-   **Search Page Browse by Category Removal (DONE)**: Removed the initial Browse by Category grid from the search page.
-   **Property Listing Card Feature Display (DONE)**: Modified  to use  for desktop view, enabling the display of icons and data for bedrooms, bathrooms, and size () on property listings.

**Earlier issues found/mentioned but not fixed**
-   None.

**Known issue recurrence from previous fork**
-   **Issue**: UI changes not appearing after code modifications due to caching.
-   **Recurrence count**: High. This issue was encountered multiple times in this session.
-   **Status**: RESOLVED (Workaround). The next agent must continue to use expo: ERROR (not running)
expo: started to reliably apply frontend changes.

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
-   **Responsive UI Design**: Used  and  to create a category row that adapts from a single row to two rows on smaller screens.
-   **Consistent Layout Architecture**: Implemented a reusable layout pattern with full-width wrapper s and constrained inner s () to enforce consistent alignment across different page sections (search bar, categories, results).
-   **Component-Based Rendering Logic**: Debugged and fixed an issue where a generic  was used for the desktop view instead of the specialized , preventing features from being displayed.
-   **Cache Busting**: Reconfirmed the necessity of restarting the
