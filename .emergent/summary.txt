<analysis>**original_problem_statement**:
The user's initial request was to build a classifieds application. The work in this session focused on implementing a seamless search experience. The user wanted to be able to type in the search bar on the homepage, be redirected to a  page, and see the results load automatically.

After the agent completed this task, the user provided new feedback and requests:
> add search suggestions/autocomplete to the homepage search bar? This could improve user experience by showing trending searches or recent searches as users type. The footer is hidding search results.Fix that issue. Fix algnment or padding issue of the search resilts page

**PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS**:
1.  **Homepage Search Flow (Completed)**: When a user types a query on the homepage and submits, they should be redirected to  and see the search results immediately.
2.  **Footer Bug (New)**: The footer on the search results page should not overlap or hide the search results.
3.  **UI Polish (New)**: Fix alignment and padding issues on the search results page.
4.  **Search Autocomplete (New)**: Implement search suggestions on the homepage search bar.

**User's preferred language**: English

**what currently exists?**
The classifieds application has a functional homepage-to-search-results flow. The primary bug from the previous session, where the search page failed to auto-search on redirect, has been resolved. The fix involved forcing a full-page navigation on the web platform by using  in the homepage component (). This bypasses an issue with Expo Router's client-side navigation not triggering the necessary component lifecycle hooks for the auto-search to function. The obsolete duplicate search file has also been deleted.

**Last working item**:
The agent's last action was completing the fix for the homepage-to-search-results flow and verifying it.

-   **Last item agent was working**: Validating the fix for the seamless search experience.
-   **Status**: USER VERIFICATION PENDING (The agent verified it with the testing subagent, but the user has since reported new, related UI bugs).
-   **Agent Testing Done**: Y
-   **Which testing method agent to use?**: frontend testing agent (to verify the new bug fixes and ensure no regressions).
-   **User Testing Done**: N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
-   **Issue 1: Footer hides search results** (Priority: P0 - HIGHEST)
    -   **Description**: The user reported that on the search results page, the page footer is overlapping and hiding the search result content. This is a critical UI bug.
    -   **Next debug checklist**:

        2.  Inspect the CSS for the main content container and the footer in .
        3.  The main container likely needs a  or  equal to the height of the footer to create space. Alternatively, a flexbox layout on the parent container could be used to ensure the content and footer do not overlap.

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
-   **Expo Router SSR/Hydration Issue**: The core problem was that client-side navigation () on Expo Router for web didn't reliably trigger component lifecycle hooks.
-   **Solution (Full Page Navigation)**: The fix involved forcing a full page reload for web users by using  instead of . This ensures a fresh server render and proper client-side hydration.

**key DB schema**
-   No database schema changes were made.

**changes in tech stack**
-   None.

**All files of reference**
-   : The search results page. This is where the new UI bugs (footer overlap, padding) need to be fixed.
-   : The homepage. The search flow originates here. The new autocomplete feature will be added to this file.
-   : The root layout file.

**Areas that need refactoring**:
-   None. The major refactoring (deleting the duplicate file) was completed.

**key api endpoints**
-   : Used by the search page to fetch results.

**Critical Info for New Agent**
-   The previous agent just completed fixing the main search flow, and the user immediately responded with new UI bugs and a feature request before the agent could formally finish.
-   **Your immediate priority is to address the user's latest feedback**:
    1.  **Fix the footer** that is hiding search results on the search page. (P0)
    2.  **Fix alignment/padding issues** on the search results page. (P1)
-   After fixing the bugs, plan the implementation for the **search suggestions/autocomplete** feature on the homepage.
-   The core search functionality is working and has been tested. Be careful not to introduce regressions while fixing the UI bugs.
