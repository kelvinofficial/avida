<analysis>**original_problem_statement**:
The user's initial request was to build a classifieds application.

Most recent user requests:
1.  **Skeleton Loader Polish**: Add visual feedback animations to the skeleton loaders (like a shimmer effect with customizable colors) to make them more polished. This was approved by the user as the next task.

PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS:
1.  **Skeleton Loader**: The skeleton loader should reflect the actual layout of the pages and have a shimmer animation.
2.  **Location Dropdown Enhancements**: Ensure the new location dropdown is present in the header on all pages. (Completed by refactoring homepage).
3.  **Footer Improvements**: Add a background image, make it responsive, and separate links. (Completed).
4.  **Functionality Implementation**: Wire up all static buttons and links. (Completed for footer and other known links).
5.  **UI Polish**: Use an appropriate icon for My Listings and add hover animations to footer links. (Completed).

**User's preferred language**: English

**what currently exists?**
The agent has successfully completed several key frontend tasks. The static links in the footer (, , ) are now wired up to newly created pages. A major refactoring of the homepage was completed, replacing its custom header with the shared  component, which makes the UI consistent and integrates the global location selector. Building on this, the agent implemented page-specific skeleton loaders by adding logic to the main layout file to render different skeletons based on the current route. Finally, a long-standing recurring issue with an unreliable login button in automated tests has been resolved by adding  props to the login form elements.

**Last working item**:
The agent's last task was fixing the unreliable login button for automated tests. This task is complete and has been verified.

-   **Last item agent was working**: Adding  props to interactive elements on the login page () to make them reliably selectable in automated tests.
-   **Status**: COMPLETED
-   **Agent Testing Done**: Y
-   **Which testing method agent to use?**: NA (Testing is complete. The agent used the  with the  flag to inspect the DOM and confirm the  attributes were rendered correctly, then confirmed a login flow could be initiated.)
-   **User Testing Done**: N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
-   **Issue 1**: Unreliable login button in automated tests (Priority: P2)
    -   **Status**: RESOLVED

**Issues Detail**:
-   **Issue 1: Unreliable login button in automated tests**
    -   **Attempted fixes**: The agent added the  prop to the email input, password input, password toggle, and submit button in . After a frontend service restart, it was verified that these props correctly render as  attributes in the web build, making the elements selectable.
    -   **Status**: RESOLVED
    -   **Is recurring issue?**: Y (This was a recurring issue that is now fixed).

**In progress Task List**:
-   None. All tasks from the previous session were completed.

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
**Upcoming Tasks:**
-   **P0: Add Shimmer Animation to Skeleton Loaders**: Based on the user's approval, enhance the newly implemented skeleton loaders with a visual feedback animation, like a shimmer or pulse effect, to improve the perceived loading experience.

**Future Tasks:**
-   Implement Photography Guides Admin CRUD functionality.
-   Improve the visual appearance of image placeholders on the search results page.
-   Consider adding real-time updates to the Quick Stats section (e.g., via WebSockets).
-   Perform end-to-end testing of the premium subscription flow.

**Completed work in this session**
-   **Footer Links Wired Up**: Created the  page and updated  to correctly link to all support pages (, , ). Also corrected a  path from  to .
-   **Homepage Header Refactored**: Replaced the custom header in  with the shared  component, successfully integrating the global location state () and unifying the app's UI.
-   **Page-Specific Skeleton Loaders**: Implemented logic in  using  to conditionally render different skeleton components based on the current route, improving the loading experience for pages like Home, Search, and Profile.
-   **Unreliable Login Button Fixed**: Resolved a recurring testing issue by adding  props to all interactive elements on the login page (), making automated tests more stable.

**Earlier issues found/mentioned but not fixed**
-   None. The previously known issue regarding the login button was resolved in this session.

**Known issue recurrence from previous fork**
-   **Issue recurrence in previous fork**: Unreliable login button in automated tests.
-   **Recurrence count**: 3+
-   **Status**: RESOLVED

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
-   **Component Refactoring**: A large, single-file header implementation on the homepage was successfully replaced with a reusable, shared  component, improving code maintainability.
-   **State Synchronization**: Synchronized a component's local state with a global Zustand store () using a  hook to manage location data consistently.
-   **React Native Web Testing**: Debugged and fixed an automated testing issue by adding the  prop to components, learning that it compiles to the  HTML attribute and sometimes requires a service restart to be applied correctly.
-   **Conditional Rendering with Expo Router**: Used the  hook from Expo Router within the  file to conditionally render different skeleton loading components based on the active route.

**key DB schema**
-   No changes.

**changes in tech stack**
-   None.

**All files of reference**
-   : Was significantly refactored to use the shared header.
-   : Modified to add  props to resolve a recurring testing issue.
-   : Updated to handle page-specific skeleton loaders.
-   : Links were updated to point to correct, functional pages.
-   : A new static page created to complete the footer links.
-   : The directory containing the various skeleton components used in .

**Areas that need refactoring**:
-   None. The major refactoring tasks from the previous session (homepage header, skeleton logic) have been completed.

**key api endpoints**
-   No changes.

**Critical Info for New Agent**
-   **Testing with **: The standard for making elements accessible to automated tests is to use the  prop in the React Native Web code. This resolves the previously unreliable login tests.
-   **Completed Refactoring**: The homepage () now uses the shared . Do not attempt to re-implement custom header logic there. The skeleton loading logic in  is also complete and can be extended for new routes.
