<analysis>**original_problem_statement:**
The user's requests were provided incrementally throughout the session. The key requirements were:
1.  Standardize the design of listing cards across all pages (Home, Category, Saved, My Listings).
2.  Add a Just Listed badge to cards for listings less than 24 hours old.
3.  Add a Page Views counter overlay on the bottom right of the listing card image.
4.  Increase the size of listing cards on the desktop version of the Category page to better utilize screen space.
5.  Increase the listing card image size by 15%.
6.  Set the max content width of the desktop Category page to 1280px.
7.  **PRODUCT REQUIREMENT:** Remove all loading indicators (spinners, skeletons, Loading... text) from the application to improve perceived performance. Pages should render instantly with cached or empty data and update silently when new data arrives.
8.  Fix a bug where No listings found flashes on the screen before the actual listings are displayed.
9.  Create a new responsive footer component for tablet and desktop versions and add it to the application.

**User's preferred language**: English

**what currently exists?**
The agent has performed a series of UI enhancements. Listing cards across the Home, Category, Saved, and My Listings pages have been standardized with location, time posted, Just Listed badges, and a view counter overlay. The layout of the desktop Category page was adjusted to have larger cards, and its max-width was set to 1280px. A major effort was made to remove all page-level loading indicators to create an instant load experience, and a subsequent bug causing a No listings flash was addressed. A new responsive footer component has been created and integrated into the Home and Category pages.

**Last working item**:
-   **Last item agent was working:** Implementing a new responsive footer for tablet and desktop versions of the application. The agent created a new component (), added it to the Home and Category pages, and was in the process of verifying its implementation.
-   **Status:** IN PROGRESS
-   **Agent Testing Done:** Y (Partially. The footer was confirmed to be working and visible on the Category page. Verification on the Home page was in progress.)
-   **Which testing method agent to use?** Frontend testing agent
-   **User Testing Done:** N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
-   **Issue 1:** The user has repeatedly reported not seeing visual changes (like the 1280px max-width and the fix for the No listings flash) after the agent implemented and verified them. This is a recurring communication-gap issue, most likely caused by browser caching on the user's end.
    -   **Attempted fixes:** The agent implemented the required code changes and verified them with screenshots. The agent also advised the user to perform a hard refresh and clear their cache.
    -   **Next debug checklist:** The next agent MUST be proactive about this. After implementing any visual change, explicitly instruct the user to perform a hard refresh ( or ) or use an incognito window to verify. Do not assume the fix is broken if the user's first response is I see no changes.
    -   **Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?** Resolving this process issue will prevent rework and ensure the user can correctly validate the agent's changes, leading to faster progress.
    -   **Status:** USER VERIFICATION PENDING
    -   **Is recurring issue?** Y
    -   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?** Frontend
    -   **Blocked on other issue:** None

**In progress Task List**:
-   **Task 1:** Complete the responsive footer implementation. (P0)
    -   **Where to resume:** The footer component exists at . It has been added to  (Home) and  (Category).
    -   **Next Steps:**
        1.  Verify the footer displays correctly at the bottom of the Home page.
        2.  Add the footer to other relevant pages for a consistent desktop/tablet experience. Good candidates are , , and . The footer should be conditionally rendered using .
    -   **What will be achieved with this?** A consistent, professional-looking footer across all main pages of the application on larger screens.
    -   **Status:** IN PROGRESS
    -   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?** Frontend
    -   **Blocked on something:** None

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
There are no other explicit upcoming tasks. The next steps should focus on completing the footer implementation and confirming all previous changes with the user.

**Completed work in this session**
-   **Listing Card Standardization:** Unified the design of listing cards across multiple pages (, , , ) to include location, time posted, and badges.
-   **'Just Listed' Badge:** Added logic to all listing cards to display a Just Listed badge for items posted within the last 24 hours.
-   **View Counter Overlay:** Implemented a view count overlay on the bottom-right of listing card images across all pages, including specialized category cards (, ).
-   **Performance Optimization (Loading States):** Removed nearly all page-level loading indicators (spinners, skeletons) across the application to improve perceived load speed, per user requirements. The app now renders content shells immediately.
-   **Bug Fix (UI Flash):** Fixed an issue where No listings yet would briefly flash on the Home and Category pages before data was displayed by introducing an  state.
-   **Category Page Layout:**
    -   Increased listing card image height by 15% in  to make them visually larger.
    -   Adjusted the layout logic in  to make cards bigger and fill available space.
    -   Set the max content width of the desktop Category page to 1280px.

**Earlier issues found/mentioned but not fixed**
No code-related issues were mentioned and left unfixed. The primary unresolved issue is the user's difficulty in seeing implemented changes, which is a process/caching problem (detailed in All Pending/In progress Issue list).

**Known issue recurrence from previous fork**
None.

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
-   **Frontend:** React Native for Web, Expo
-   **Styling:** Inline styles with 
-   **State Management:** Zustand for global state (), / for local component state.
-   **Routing:** Expo Router (file-based).
-   **Responsive Design:** A custom  hook is used to conditionally render components and apply styles for different screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop).

**key DB schema**
The agent did not interact with the database directly. However, the frontend consumes listing objects with the following relevant keys: , , , , , , , .

**changes in tech stack**
None.

**All files of reference**
-    (Created): A new responsive footer component for desktop and tablet views.
-    (Updated): Home page; cards updated, loading removed, footer added.
-    (Updated): Category page; cards updated, layout adjusted, loading removed, footer added.
-    (Updated): Saved page; cards updated, loading removed.
-    (Updated): My Listings page; cards updated, loading removed.
-    (Updated): The primary shared card component; styles and features were added here.
-    (Updated): Added view counter.
-    (Updated): Added view counter.
-    (Updated): Listing detail page; loading indicators removed.

**Areas that need refactoring**:
-   **Style Consolidation:** Many pages (Home, Saved, My Listings) still contain significant inline styling for their listing cards instead of relying completely on the shared  component. Refactoring these to use the shared component more effectively would reduce code duplication.
-   **Data Fetching Logic:** The  state flag was added to both the Home and Category pages to prevent a UI flash. This logic could be abstracted into a reusable custom hook (e.g., ) to clean up the page components and avoid duplication.

**key api endpoints**
No new API endpoints were created. The agent worked exclusively on the frontend.

**Critical Info for New Agent**
-   **User Cache Issues:** The user frequently reports not seeing your changes. This is almost certainly a browser cache issue. **After every visual change, you must instruct the user to do a hard refresh (Cmd+Shift+R or Ctrl+Shift+R).** Do not assume your fix is broken without this step.
-   **Footer Task:** The current task is to finish implementing the new responsive footer. It has been created and added to the Home and Category pages. You need to verify it on the Home page and then add it to other key pages (, , etc.) to ensure a consistent experience.
-   **Loading State Philosophy:** The goal was to remove all *initial page-level* loading indicators. Loading spinners on buttons that trigger user actions (e.g., Submit Offer) are acceptable and should remain.
