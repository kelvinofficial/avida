<analysis>**original_problem_statement**:
The user's initial request was to build a classifieds application. The work has progressed through several stages.

The user's most recent requests were:
1.  add search suggestions/autocomplete to the homepage search bar? This could improve user experience by showing trending searches or recent searches as users type.
2.  The footer is hidding search results.Fix that issue.
3.  Fix algnment or padding issue of the search resilts page
4.  After the agent fixed the above, the user added: i can not see icons on various parts of the app and website. Can you fix that issue and make it not happen again. All ICONS should be stored locally

**PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS**:
1.  **Homepage Search Flow (Completed)**: Redirect from homepage to  with the query.
2.  **Footer Bug (Completed)**: The footer on the search results page should not overlap results.
3.  **UI Polish (Completed)**: Alignment and padding issues on the search results page are fixed.
4.  **Search Autocomplete (Completed)**: Search suggestions are now implemented on the homepage search bar.
5.  **Local Icons (New)**: Icons must be bundled locally with the application to prevent network-related loading failures.

**User's preferred language**: English

**what currently exists?**
The agent successfully fixed two UI bugs on the search results page (): a footer that was overlapping content and general padding/alignment issues. Following that, the agent implemented a new search autocomplete feature on the homepage (), which displays trending searches fetched from the backend. All these changes were verified and passed tests run by the . Immediately after, the user reported that icons are failing to load across the app.

**Last working item**:
The agent just received a new bug report from the user about icons not loading. The agent's investigation revealed a 520 network error when trying to fetch the  font file, and acknowledged the user's request to fix this by storing icons locally.

-   **Last item agent was working**: Investigating the root cause of missing icons and planning to bundle them locally.
-   **Status**: NOT STARTED
-   **Agent Testing Done**: N
-   **Which testing method agent to use?**: screenshot tool. After fixing the issue, take a screenshot of a page that previously had missing icons (like the homepage) to confirm they now render correctly.
-   **User Testing Done**: N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
-   **Issue 1: Icons are not loading due to network error** (Priority: P0 - HIGHEST)
    -   **Description**: The user reported that icons are missing throughout the app. Investigation showed a 520 network error when fetching . The user has explicitly requested that all icons be stored locally to prevent this issue from recurring.
    -   **Next debug checklist**:
        1.  Investigate how Expo for Web handles font assets. The issue is likely related to the build configuration.
        2.  Identify the package providing the icons (likely ).
        3.  Modify the application's build configuration (e.g.,  or a custom ) to ensure that font files like  are bundled directly into the application's assets rather than being fetched from a CDN.
        4.  Verify that the  hook or equivalent component is correctly configured to load the font from the local bundle.
    -   **Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?**: This is a critical UI/UX bug. Missing icons make the application appear broken and hinder user navigation. Storing icons locally will make the UI more robust and independent of network conditions.
    -   **Status**: NOT STARTED
    -   **Is recurring issue?**: N
    -   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?**: frontend
-   **Issue 2: Unreliable login button in automated tests** (Priority: P2)
    -   **Description**: A known, low-priority issue where the login button is sometimes not found or is unresponsive during automated tests, forcing a programmatic login workaround.
    -   **Attempted fixes**: None.
    -   **Status**: NOT STARTED
    -   **Is recurring issue?**: Y
    -   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?**: frontend

**In progress Task List**:
-   None.

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
**Upcoming Tasks:**
-   **P2**: Implement Photography Guides Admin CRUD functionality. The placeholder page exists at .

**Future Tasks:**
-   Improve the visual appearance of image placeholders on the search results page.
-   Consider adding real-time updates to the Quick Stats section (e.g., via WebSockets).
-   Perform end-to-end testing of the premium subscription flow.

**Completed work in this session**
-   **Search Page UI Bugs (FIXED)**: Resolved the footer overlap and padding/alignment issues on .
-   **Homepage Search Autocomplete (IMPLEMENTED)**: Added a search suggestions dropdown to the homepage search bar in , showing trending searches from the API. Implemented for both mobile and desktop views.
-   **Testing**: Validated the UI fixes and the new autocomplete feature with , which reported 100% success.

**Earlier issues found/mentioned but not fixed**
-   None.

**Known issue recurrence from previous fork**
-   **Issue recurrence in previous fork**: Unreliable login button in automated tests.
-   **Recurrence count**: 3+
-   **Status**: NOT STARTED

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
-   **React Native Web Styling**: The agent used  to implement responsive designs for both mobile and web, troubleshooting CSS properties like , , and  to correctly render the autocomplete UI.
-   **Expo Asset Bundling**: The current critical issue requires understanding how Expo and its bundler (Metro/Webpack) handle font assets for web builds in order to force local bundling.

**key DB schema**
-   No database schema changes were made.

**changes in tech stack**
-   None.

**All files of reference**
-   : Homepage file where the autocomplete feature was implemented.
-   : Search results page where UI bugs were fixed.
-    or a custom  (Potential): These files are the most likely candidates for modification to fix the icon bundling issue.

**Areas that need refactoring**:
-   None.

**key api endpoints**
-   : Fetches trending searches for the homepage autocomplete feature.

**Critical Info for New Agent**
-   The previous agent successfully completed all its assigned tasks (UI bug fixes, new autocomplete feature) and confirmed them with the testing agent.
-   **Your immediate and highest priority (P0) is to address the new bug reported by the user: icons are not loading.**
-   The user has a clear requirement: **icons must be stored locally** to prevent future network-related failures. This is not just a bug fix but a change in how assets are handled.
-   Your work should focus on modifying the build configuration to bundle font files with the application.
