<analysis>**original_problem_statement**:
The user's initial request was to build a full-stack classifieds application. The application has since evolved with multiple feature additions, including a comprehensive SEO suite and an AI-powered SEO tool in the admin dashboard.

The latest requests were to:
1.  **Verify** the AI-Powered SEO feature implemented in the previous session.
2.  Implement **Full Offline Mode Support** for the main application.
3.  Implement an **SEO Performance Analytics** dashboard for the admin panel.

**User's preferred language**: English

**what currently exists?**
A stable, full-stack classifieds application with a dual-frontend architecture: a main user-facing app (React Native/Expo) and a separate admin dashboard (Next.js). The backend is built with FastAPI and uses MongoDB.

The agent successfully completed the implementation of two new major features:
1.  **Full Offline Mode Support**: The main application can now queue actions like listing creation while offline and sync them with the server upon reconnection. This involved creating backend sync endpoints and enhancing the frontend's offline storage and synchronization logic.
2.  **SEO Performance Analytics**: A new page in the admin dashboard allows admins to track key SEO metrics like impressions, clicks, CTR, and top-performing listings. This included new backend tracking endpoints and a complete frontend UI with charts and data tables.

Additionally, the agent thoroughly verified the **AI-Powered SEO** feature from the previous session, resolving complex routing and authentication issues to confirm its functionality.

**Last working item**:
The agent just finished implementing and testing the Offline Mode and SEO Analytics features, fixed a minor code duplication issue found by the testing agent, and updated the project's documentation (). The user has given the final proceed to finish the session.

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
-   **Dual Frontend Architecture**: The project consists of a main React Native/Expo app () and a separate Next.js admin dashboard (). They share a common backend.
-   **Next.js  Configuration**: The admin dashboard is configured with , which was a critical detail discovered during debugging. All admin pages are accessed via this path prefix.
-   **Offline-First Strategy**: Implemented a robust offline mode for the main app using  to queue user actions (e.g., creating a listing) and sync them with the backend when online.
-   **Router-Specific Dependencies (FastAPI)**: To avoid authentication conflicts, a pattern was used where the  dependency is created locally within the  router factory, making it self-contained.

**key DB schema**
-   ****: (New) Stores SEO-related events. Fields include ,  ('impression' or 'click'), , and .
-   ****: Used for admin authentication. Requires , , and .

**changes in tech stack**
-   No new dependencies were added in this session.

**All files of reference**
-    (New file for offline synchronization API)
-    (New file for SEO analytics tracking API)
-    (Modified to include new routers)
-    (New frontend page for SEO analytics)
-    (Modified with new API client methods for SEO analytics)
-    (Modified to enhance offline sync logic)
-    (Modified to manage the offline action queue)
-    (Test report for the new features)
-    (Updated with latest progress)

**Areas that need refactoring**:
-   None. A code duplication issue found during testing was resolved.

**key api endpoints**
-   ****: Syncs a batch of offline actions from the client to the server. (User Auth)
-   ****: Tracks an SEO event (e.g., impression, click) for a listing. (No Auth)
-   ****: Retrieves aggregated SEO analytics for a specific listing. (Admin Auth)

**Critical Info for New Agent**
-   The two new features, **Offline Mode Support** and **SEO Performance Analytics**, are fully implemented and have passed automated tests. They are ready for user verification.
-   **Crucially, the Admin Dashboard is not at the root URL.** It is served from the  path due to the  setting in its . The login page is at . This is a non-obvious configuration that was the source of significant debugging.
-   The project has two distinct frontends. Be mindful of which one you are modifying:  for the main app and  for the admin panel.
