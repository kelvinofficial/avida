<analysis>**original_problem_statement**:
The user's initial request was to build a classifieds application.

The most recent requests were:
1.  Add real-time notifications to alert a seller when a buyer favorites their listing.
2.  Implement mobile app optimizations for performance and user experience.
3.  Add a skeleton loading animation (shimmer effect) to images in listing cards.
4.  Perform E2E testing for the premium subscription flow.
5.  Implement Admin CRUD for Photography Guides.

PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS:
1.  **Real-time Quick Stats**: The Quick Stats card on the user's dashboard must update in real-time.
2.  **Image Placeholders**: All areas that display images should show a consistent placeholder when no image is available.
3.  **Favorite Notifications**: Sellers should receive a real-time notification when another user favorites one of their listings.
4.  **Mobile Optimizations**: The mobile experience should be enhanced with better performance, improved UI/UX, and better resilience (offline support).
5.  **Skeleton Loading**: A shimmer animation should be displayed while images are loading to improve perceived performance.

**User's preferred language**: English

**what currently exists?**
The application's mobile experience has been significantly enhanced by integrating a suite of custom optimization components (, , ) into core UI elements like listing cards. An  warns users of connectivity loss. To further improve user experience, a skeleton loading (shimmer) effect has been added to the  component, providing visual feedback while images load. The premium subscription flow has been successfully verified through end-to-end testing. The backend contains a full suite of API endpoints for managing photography guides.

**Last working item**:
The agent was beginning work on the Admin CRUD for Photography Guides task. After confirming that a comprehensive set of backend API endpoints already exists, the agent was searching for an existing admin UI to manage these guides.

-   **Last item agent was working**: Investigating the frontend to implement the Admin CRUD UI for Photography Guides.
-   **Status**: IN PROGRESS
-   **Agent Testing Done**: N/A
-   **Which testing method agent to use?**: frontend testing agent. After creating the CRUD UI, the agent must test creating, reading, updating, and deleting a guide from the admin panel.
-   **User Testing Done**: N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
-   None.

**Issues Detail**:
-   None.

**In progress Task List**:
-   **Task 1: Admin CRUD for Photography Guides (P1)**
    -   **Where to resume**: The agent has confirmed the backend API exists at . The next step is to create the frontend components for the admin dashboard to perform CRUD operations on photography guides. This will likely involve creating a new page/route under .
    -   **What will be achieved with this?**: This will allow administrators to manage photography guides directly from the application's UI.
    -   **Status**: IN PROGRESS
    -   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?**: Frontend
    -   **Blocked on something**: No.

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**

**Upcoming Tasks:**
-   None specified.

**Future Tasks:**
-   No other future tasks have been defined.

**Completed work in this session**
-   **Mobile Optimization Integration (DONE)**: Replaced standard React Native components with custom, high-performance versions (, , ) across all listing cards and key scrollable views.
-   **Network Resilience Fix (DONE)**: Resolved a fatal bundling error by installing the missing  dependency and modifying the  hook to be web-compatible.
-   **Skeleton Loading Animation (DONE)**: Created a new  component and integrated it into  to display a shimmer effect while images are loading.
-   **Premium Subscription E2E Testing (DONE)**: Successfully executed end-to-end tests for the premium subscription feature using the testing agent, verifying its functionality.

**Earlier issues found/mentioned but not fixed**
-   None.

**Known issue recurrence from previous fork**
-   None.

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
-   **Mobile App Optimization**: Integrated custom components to improve performance and UX.
-   **Skeleton Loading**: Implemented a shimmer effect for loading images, improving perceived performance.
-   **Dependency Management**: Installed and configured a new dependency () for the frontend.
-   **Platform Compatibility**: Modified a React Native hook to ensure it works correctly on the web platform, preventing build failures.

**key DB schema**
-   No changes in this session.

**changes in tech stack**
-   Added  to the frontend dependencies.

**All files of reference**
-   : New component for the skeleton loading effect.
-   : Modified to include the shimmer effect.
-   : Modified to prevent crashing on the web.
-   : Updated with the new  dependency.
-   : The backend API for the next task.
-   Multiple listing card components in  were updated to use the new mobile optimization components.

**Areas that need refactoring**:
-   None.

**key api endpoints**
-   The agent explored the existing photography guides endpoints which support full CRUD operations (e.g., , , , etc.).

**Critical Info for New Agent**
-   Your immediate priority (P1) is to build the frontend UI for the **Admin CRUD for Photography Guides**.
-   The backend API is already complete and available at .
-   You should create a new page within the  directory to host this new management interface.
-   The interface should allow an admin to create, view, update, and delete photography guides.
-   Once the UI is built, use the  to perform E2E testing of the full CRUD flow.
