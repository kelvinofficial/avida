Fixed 2 bugs: 1) Frontend type badge showed 'Monthly' for seasonal challenges (fixed to show 'Seasonal'), 2) Backend challenge detail and join endpoints only searched regular challenges, not seasonal (fixed to search both). All 8 backend tests pass. Frontend correctly displays Seasonal Events section with pink header and LIMITED TIME badge.",
